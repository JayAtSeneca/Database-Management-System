The general syntax for inserting a single row of data into a table is as follows: INSERT INTO Table_Name VALUES(vaule_1, value_2, ..., value_N)

ANSWER 19

The required command to insert the data is INSERT INTO ORDERS VALUES (10316, '17-09-21', '20-09-21', '18-09-21', 'Shipped', 'Customer received the order')

The command required to show the new data inserted into the database is by using the SELECT statement and the ORDERNUMBER of the new order (10316). The command is SELECT * FROM ORDERS WHERE ORDERNUMBER=10316

ANSWER 20

The required command is INSERT INTO PRODUCTS VALUES ('S111_111', '2020 Bugatti Veyron', 'Sports Car', '1:24', 'Carousel DieCast Legends', 'The fastest supercar in the world!')
